# PalmPatcher

Fixes Seeker's Palm Blast damage not scaling past base damage and being unable to crit.

All players will need this mod in a multiplayer session.

## Why?

Palm Blast is strangely made and isnt created like every other projectile, so the crit check and damage scaling is skipped entirely, this mod makes it a real projectile that works like any other.
